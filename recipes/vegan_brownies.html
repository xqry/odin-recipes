    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you’ll need to make this homemade vegan brownie recipe: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This vegan brownie starts with all-purpose flour. </li>
        <li>Sugar: Make sure the package is labeled “vegan,” as some store-bought white sugars aren’t strictly vegan. </li>
        <li>Cocoa powder: You’ll need ¾ cups of good-quality unsweetened cocoa powder. </li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the vegan brownies rise. </li>
        <li>Salt: Salt enhances the overall flavor of the brownies, but it won’t make them taste salty. </li>
        <li>Water or coffee: Use a cup of hot water (or a cup of brewed coffee for more flavor). </li>
        <li>Oil: Vegetable oil keeps these vegan brownies nice and moist. </li>
        <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
    </ul>
